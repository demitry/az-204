# AZ-204: Developing Solutions for Microsoft Azure - NEW (Udemy, Alan Rodrigues)

## Section 2: Develop Azure compute solutions - Azure Virtual Machines

### 13. Building a simple project locally

VS -> Run as administrator, (why?) .NET Core Sample App

### 15. Lab - Building a Windows virtual machine

Create resource -> VM

Subscription (my free 200)

Resource group - logical grouping of resources

<https://portal.azure.com/#view/HubsExtension/BrowseAll>

All resources

### 16. Connecting to the Virtual Machine

Download RDP file and login

### 17. Lab - Installing Internet Information Services

Install IIS = Host our app

Start -> Server Manager (dashboard)

Dashboard -> Add roles and features Wizard

Web server (IIS), Next, Finish

Tools -> IIS Manager

Resources -> public IP 13.81.85.54

This site canâ€™t be reached 13.81.85.54 took too long to respond.

Web server by default listens on port 80

Network Security Group

Create rule to allow traffic on port 80

Networking -> Inbound port rules

RDP port 3389

Networking -> Add inbound port rule

Service - HTTP

Name - AllowAnyHTTPInbound_Port_80

AZ 104 Administration

<http://13.81.85.54/> - OK IIS page

### 18. Lab - Deploying a .NET Core app on Windows Server

VS -> Tools -> Options -> Azure Account -> OK

prj -> right click -> publish -> Azure -> Azure Virtual Machine -> Select group and VM

Publish page -> Show All Settings -> Connection ->

Enter Password, Validate Connection, Accept Security Certificate

Save

Publish

Enter password for VM

...

Publish Succeeded.

Web App was published successfully <http://appvm100.westeurope.cloudapp.azure.com/>


#### Step 1: Assign a DNS name to the VM

appvm -> Overview -> DNS Name: (appvm100) appvm100.westeurope.cloudapp.azure.com

Save -> OK, available from browser appvm100.westeurope.cloudapp.azure.com

#### Step 2: Add a rule for the port 8172 to the Network Security Group (open WebDeploy port (8172) on Azure)

Networking -> Add inbound port rule, 8172, AllowAnyCustom_Port_8172_Inbound

#### Step 3: Add the role of the Management Service on the VM

VM -> Dashboard -> Add roles and features

Web Server -> Management Tools -> Managements Service -> Next and Finish Install

#### Step 4: Check the configuration of the management service in IIS

VMs IIS -> appvm -> Managements Service -> Check "Enable remote Connections"

Note that port is 8172

"Apply", "Start" service

#### Step 5: Install the .NET Core Hosting Bundle. This allows .NET apps to be hosted on IIS

App is built under .NET 6.0.0 - the same should be on the VM

Dashboard -> Local Server -> IE Enhanced Security Configuration (is ON)

Disable to allow .NET install: Off, Off

<https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download>

<https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0>

ASP.NET Core Runtime 6.0.15 (major is 6.0) it is OK

(dotnet-hosting-6.0.15-win.exe)

Download hosting bundle and install => Runtime is available on the hosting machine

Common issue - mismatch between the versions

Download and install Web Deploy v3.6 -> "Complete" install

#### Step 6: Install the Web Deploy v3.6 tool

### 19. Lab - Building a Linux VM

### 20. Deploying our .NET App on the Linux VM

### 21. Using NGINX on the Linux VM

### 22. Keeping a check on the cost of your resources

### 23. Quick Note
