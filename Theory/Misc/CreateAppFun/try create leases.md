Azure Cosmos DB free tier is different from the Azure free account. The Azure free account offers Azure credits and resources for free for a limited time. When using Azure Cosmos DB as a part of this free account, you get 25-GB storage and 400 RU/s of provisioned throughput for 12 months.

Best practices to keep your account free
To keep your account free of charge, your account shouldn't have any more RU/s or storage consumption other than the one offered by the Azure Cosmos DB free tier.

For example, the following are some options that donâ€™t result in any monthly charge:

One database with a max of 1000 RU/s provisioned throughput.
Two containers one with a max of 400 RU/s and other with a max of 600 RU/s provisioned throughput.
Account with two regions with a single region that has one container with a max of 500 RU/s provisioned throughput.

I created both Azure Cosmos db and Azure Function with Cosmos trigger, but not working and leases container also not created. Please help me to resolve this.

I got the same issue, and I found the root cause - the leases container was not created, I tried to create it manually and got an error "Bad request, ... "Your account is currently configured with a total throughput limit of 1000 RU. This operation failed because it would have increased the total throughput to 1200 RU", so I deleted the Customers container to reduce RU, restarted the function, and the leases container was created automatically. https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/free-tier
